General
* Use pimpl pattern to avoid engine having dependencies on eternal projects
* Add project include dir to include path, remove ../ from include paths
* Forward declares, where can they be used?

Core
* Node
* octree<Node>
* Node will need a transform to be sorted by

Graphics

* Add diagnostics early
* Focus on true bounce lighting (ray-tracing)
* consider using gltf instead of tinyobj, standardizes asset values
