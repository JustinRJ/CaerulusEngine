General
* Use pimpl pattern to avoid engine having dependencies on eternal projects
* Add project name to stadafx to remove false intellisense error

* Create frustrum class in math, camera will use this as well as graphics engine
* Implement thread class with async as basis

Core
* Node
* octree<Node>
* Node will need a transform to be sorted by

Graphics

* Focus on true bounce lighting (ray-tracing)
* consider using gltf instead of tinyobj, standardizes asset values
